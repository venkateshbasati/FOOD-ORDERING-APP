TailWind CSS Framework  (ADVs/ Features)
- CSS on the go (in the same file)
- resuabilty
-less bundle size
-Flexible UI (Customisation possible)
- evertything in tailwind works with Classnames 

Along with Tailwind , we have to use POSTCSS which  tells parcel bundle  in converting these
classes of tailwind to browser understandable/readable, because browser cannot understand 
the classes of tailwind directly...

// *** USE TAILWIND EXTENSION IMP ***
IMP point :- Tailwindcss  only transfer those classes that have used projects to production , it makes the bundle size less
 we can also see in index.css network tab  on inspect. parcel with the help of postcss , it converts  tailwoind classes to normal browser css
